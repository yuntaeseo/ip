## Tips & Tricks

2. **Leverage search**: Use `find` to quickly locate specific tasks
3. **Keep deadlines realistic**: Set achievable deadlines to stay motivated
4. **Regular cleanup**: Use `delete` to remove completed or outdated tasks

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong date format**: Always use `YYYY-MM-DD` format for dates
2. **Missing task numbers**: Remember that task numbers start from 1
3. **Empty descriptions**: Task descriptions cannot be empty
4. **Incomplete commands**: Make sure to include all required parameters

### üîß Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "task number is not in list" | Check your task list with `list` and use valid numbers |
| "Invalid date" | Use the correct format: `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| "description cannot be empty" | Provide a meaningful task description |
| "No tasks found" | Your search didn't match any tasks |
